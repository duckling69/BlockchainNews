## Phantom Press
Reveal Truth, not Your Identity

# The problem it solves
Phantom Press is a decentralized media app that uses InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store news information. One problem that Phantom Press aims to solve is the centralization of traditional media outlets, which can lead to censorship and bias in the information that is presented to the public. By using a decentralized platform like IPFS, Phantom Press allows for a more open and transparent distribution of news, as the information is stored on a distributed network rather than being controlled by a single entity. This can help to promote freedom of expression and ensure that a diverse range of viewpoints is represented.

# Challenges we ran into
As we worked on developing Phantom Press, we faced a number of challenges. One of the biggest challenges was learning about IPFS and how to incorporate it into our app in a short amount of time. It required a lot of effort and dedication, but we were able to get up to speed and understand the technology well enough to use it effectively in our app.

Another challenge we faced was creating a good user interface (UI). It was important for us to create an interface that was both aesthetically pleasing and functional, but achieving this balance was not always easy. It took a lot of time and effort to design and test the UI to make sure it was intuitive and easy to use for our users.

In addition to these technical challenges, it was also challenging to work with a team. Collaborating with others can bring its own set of challenges, such as coordinating schedules, resolving conflicts, and ensuring that everyone is on the same page. However, we were able to overcome these challenges and work effectively as a team to bring Phantom Press to fruition.
